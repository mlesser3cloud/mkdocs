# FinOps

FinOps makes cloud spend measurable and actionable.

## Baseline practices

- Tagging standard: owner, environment, cost center
- Budgets + alerts for key scopes
- Monthly review cadence with action items

## Migration-specific guidance

- Expect temporary double-run costs during cutovers.
- Track cost by wave to validate sizing assumptions.
- Optimize *after* stabilization to avoid thrash.
