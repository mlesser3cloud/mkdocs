# Security & compliance

Security outcomes should be enforced by defaults, not by heroics.

## Baseline controls (starter set)

- Identity: MFA, conditional access, least privilege, time-bound elevation
- Logging: centralized, searchable, retained for your needs
- Network: controlled egress, restricted inbound, segmentation
- Data: encryption in transit and at rest, key management decisions
- Vulnerability management: patching, scanning, and remediation SLAs

## Evidence mindset

Instead of “we are compliant”, aim for “we can **prove** compliance continuously”.

Questions to answer:

- What evidence is generated automatically?
- Where is it stored and for how long?
- Who reviews it and how often?
