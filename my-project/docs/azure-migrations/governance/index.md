# Governance

Governance keeps migrations consistent across teams and waves.

## What governance should cover

- Resource organization: subscriptions/projects and ownership
- Standards: naming, tagging, regions, approved services
- Guardrails: policy-as-code and drift detection
- Exception process: how teams request deviations
- Cost management: budgets, chargeback/showback, reviews

## Suggested ceremonies

- Weekly wave review (scope, blockers, risks)
- Architecture review (patterns and exceptions)
- Security/compliance review (evidence and control health)
- FinOps review (trend, anomalies, optimization backlog)
