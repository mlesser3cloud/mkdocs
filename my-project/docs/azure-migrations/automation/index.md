# Automation (IaC)

Infrastructure as Code enables consistency across dozens (or hundreds) of workloads.

## Principles

- Everything reproducible from code (including policy and monitoring onboarding)
- PR-based reviews and audit trails
- Secrets and sensitive config handled safely

## What to automate first

- Subscription/project provisioning
- Network hub/spokes and DNS
- Policy baselines and logging
- Monitoring onboarding for new workloads
