# ADRs

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) capture decisions that affect multiple teams and waves.

## Rules of thumb

- Write an ADR when a decision changes defaults.
- Keep ADRs short.
- If you change your mind, create a new ADR and reference the old one.

Start with the [ADR template](adr-template.md).
