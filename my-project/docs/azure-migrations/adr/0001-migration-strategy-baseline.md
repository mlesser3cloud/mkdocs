# ADR 0001: Migration strategy baseline

## Status

Proposed

## Context

We need a consistent way to classify workloads and make tradeoffs explicit.

## Decision

We will classify workloads using the 6Rs and require wave planning to document the chosen approach per workload.

## Consequences

- Faster alignment across teams
- More explicit exceptions when rehost is not appropriate
