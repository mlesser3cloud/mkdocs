# Modernize & optimize

Modernization is how you reduce long-term cost and operational burden after the initial move.

## Typical modernization backlog

- Replace self-managed components with managed services
- Remove legacy auth patterns; standardize identity
- Improve deployment safety (CI/CD, canary/blue-green)
- Introduce autoscaling and resilience patterns

## Practical approach

1. Stabilize the workload first (monitoring, backups, incident response).
2. Prioritize modernization by ROI (risk reduction, ops reduction, cost).
3. Track modernization work as part of the same product backlog.
