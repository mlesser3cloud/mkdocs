## 6Rs
A set of common migration dispositions: rehost, refactor, replatform, repurchase, retire, retain.

## Azure Migrate
An Azure service family used to discover, assess, and migrate workloads to Azure. Capabilities and prerequisites vary; verify current behavior in official Azure documentation.

## CAF (Cloud Adoption Framework)
Microsoft guidance for adopting cloud: strategy, plan, ready, adopt, govern, and manage.

## Cutover
The controlled transition from the source environment to the Azure target, including traffic switching, validation, and rollback readiness.

## Dependency mapping
The process of identifying technical and business dependencies between systems (network calls, data flows, identity integrations, batch jobs).

## Landing zone
A pre-configured Azure foundation that provides identity, networking, governance, security, and operational baselines.

## Management group
A container in Azure used to organize subscriptions for governance (policy and RBAC) at scale.

## PaaS
Platform-as-a-Service. Cloud services where the provider manages more of the platform (patching/availability) compared with IaaS.

## Pilot
A small, low-risk migration used to prove end-to-end processes and produce a repeatable runbook.

## RACI
A responsibility model: Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed.

## Rehost
Move a workload largely unchanged to Azure infrastructure.

## Replatform
Move a workload with limited changes to leverage managed services or reduce operational burden.

## Refactor
Re-architect an application to better use cloud-native patterns.

## RPO (Recovery Point Objective)
Maximum acceptable data loss measured in time (e.g., 15 minutes).

## RTO (Recovery Time Objective)
Maximum acceptable time to restore service after an outage.

## Wave
A planned batch of workloads migrated together with a shared schedule, runbook, and validation.
